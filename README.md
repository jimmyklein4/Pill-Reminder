# PillPal

We have all heard of apps to remind people to take pills. But what if there was a pill bottle that would serve as the reminder?

Pill pal does just that!

Using the sparkcore, we have rigged a pill bottle to schedule dosages and alert the user. The doctor can perscribe dosages via the android app and once the scheduled time has passed, the LED on the bottle will turn red to alert the patient of a missed medication.

Best of all, the pill bottle can be scheduled remotely. The patient can also be alerted by the pebble smart watch app of when the dosage was missed.
